To create a so called weighted graph, we had to create a new object called "Edge" that now stores our information.  
The main Graph is still in "Adjacency List" form, but now we use a Priority Queue instead to make our access time much quicker
The Prim and Kruskal MST Algorithms are implemented inside of the "TestGraphs" class!
