There are lots of implementations for Hamiltonian Circuit detection...  
The one that I chose to implement uses the Backtracking approach of solving.  
Being Backtracking the Graph is implemented as a "Adjacency Matrix" with integer weights.  
The "main" Algorithm can again be found inside of the "TestGraphs" class
