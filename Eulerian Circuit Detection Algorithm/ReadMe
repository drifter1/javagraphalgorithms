This Algorithm uses the "Adjacency List" impementation, having integer weights.  
To solve this problem more easily we check for "Connectivity" using the isConnected() function.  
Checking if the Graph is "connected" is very important and one of the basic concepts of Graph Theory!   
The main Algorithm can again be found inside of the "TestGraph" class
