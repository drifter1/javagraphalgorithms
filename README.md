A short Description of this repository:  
Implementations of Graph Algorithms in the Object-Oriented Programming Language: "Java".  

This is a Github repository that gives you access to all the Code written during the Steemit-Series: "Java Graphs" of Steemit user @drifter1 (which is me).  

Until now I implemented the following:  
Adjacency Matrix and List implementation of a Graph -> https://steemit.com/programming/@drifter1/programming-java-graphs-introduction  
Traversal Algorithms (BFS and DFS) -> https://steemit.com/programming/@drifter1/programming-java-graph-traversal-algorithms  
Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms (Kruskal and Prim) -> https://steemit.com/programming/@drifter1/programming-java-graph-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithms  
Shortest Path Algorithm (Dijkstra) -> https://steemit.com/graphs/@drifter1/programming-java-graph-shortest-path-algorithm-dijkstra  
Shortest Path Algorithm (Bellman-Ford) -> https://steemit.com/programming/@drifter1/programming-java-graph-shortest-path-algorithm-bellman-ford  
All Pair Shortest Path Algorithm (Floyd-Warshall) -> https://steemit.com/programming/@drifter1/programming-java-graph-all-pair-shortest-path-algorithms-floyd-warshall-johnson  
Maximum Flow Algorithm (Ford-Fulkerson) -> https://steemit.com/programming/@drifter1/programming-java-graph-maximum-flow-algorithm-ford-fulkerson  
Backtracking Hamiltonian Circuit Algorithm -> https://steemit.com/programming/@drifter1/programming-java-graph-backtracking-hamiltonian-circuit-algorithm  
Eulerian Circuit Detection Algorithm -> https://steemit.com/programming/@drifter1/programming-java-graph-eulerian-circuit-detection-algorithm  
Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms 2 (Boruvka and Reverse Delete) -> https://steemit.com/programming/@drifter1/programming-java-graph-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithms-2  
Graph Coloring (Greedy and Backtracking) -> ...  

(For now) Next on my list are:  
The Travelling Salesman Problem and Algorithms that solve it  
Vertex Cover Problem
