The main implementation of the Traversal Algorithm's Graph still remains...  
But, we now also add a "Vertex"-object to make the Algortihm implementation much easier.  
This means that the "main" Graph is still using Edges and that we just defined another  
class that helps us in the implementation of Dijkstra!  
The Algorithm is again inside of the "TestGraphs" class
