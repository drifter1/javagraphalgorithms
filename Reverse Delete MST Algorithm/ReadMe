This Algorithm is a somewhat reverse/oppositev version of Kruskal.  
We use the same Graph as in Kruskal, which means Adjacency List with Edges.  
The Algorithm is again using a "Connectivity"-check function and also DFS.  
The actual Algorithm is inside of "TestGraphs", but calls lots of functions of "Graph"!
